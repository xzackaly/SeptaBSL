# SEPTA Broad Street Line (BSL) with color added

SEPTA's consolidated BSL schedule...great for planning downtown excursions...terrible for figuring out which row is the Express and which is the 8th&Market. For me.  If you know how...GREAT. Me?  Welcome to my first *something-I-want* Python project.
